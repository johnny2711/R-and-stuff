Tyler's Comments

2016.09.26 - Great work Johannes. Your participation in class has been very
welcome and you seem to be catching on to most of the ideas quickly. I think
everyone had similar issues in translating the problem set from my jargon
to your own vocabulary, so check out the correction to see what I was aiming at.
Keep up the good work and try to come back to HW3, as functions and nested
functions are important and difficult. See you Friday!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Very good work. Keep in mind though global variables (see
the code for inline comments) and always have functions either explicitly do
something, either return or print, but don't use simply `beta` as in the last
line of the function, this is not a clean approach. That being said great job!

2016.10.25 - HW5 and HW6 - Thanks for the note! I understand these
             weeks are very busy. Thanks for your note about the comments
             also, good to know someone is reading them! I hope your
             tests went well and you enjoy the break.

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - Only 7 submitted, but problems with os update caused
             devtools to break? Great job and thanks for not including any
             spoilers... I'm about to start the last book!
