Tyler's Comments

2016.09.26 - Great work Johannes. Your participation in class has been very
welcome and you seem to be catching on to most of the ideas quickly. I think
everyone had similar issues in translating the problem set from my jargon
to your own vocabulary, so check out the correction to see what I was aiming at.
Keep up the good work and try to come back to HW3, as functions and nested
functions are important and difficult. See you Friday!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Very good work. Keep in mind though global variables (see
the code for inline comments) and always have functions either explicitly do
something, either return or print, but don't use simply `beta` as in the last
line of the function, this is not a clean approach. That being said great job!
