2016.09.26 - Great work Johannes. Your participation in class has been very 
welcome and you seem to be catching on to most of the ideas quickly. I think
everyone had similar issues in translating the problem set from my jargon
to your own vocabulary, so check out the correction to see what I was aiming at.
Keep up the good work and try to come back to HW3, as functions and nested
functions are important and difficult. See you Friday!
