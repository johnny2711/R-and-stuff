#Hi Tyler, this & next week my priority is to survive the midterms,
#so I really haven't found the time to do the HW. However, thereafter 
#the programming course has my undivided attention!!  
#P.S: I appreciate that you take the time to add comments to each of the 
#homeworks, this is very helpful in avoiding future mistakes!
